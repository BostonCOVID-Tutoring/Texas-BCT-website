As Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Boston COVID-Tutoring (BCT), David heads the operations of the organization and engages in the development of organizational ideas, objectives, projects while overseeing various departments of BCT’s Management Team and frequently communicating with BCT’s tutors and families. David founded this organization after coming to the realization that knowledge is truly one of the most powerful and influential aspects of one’s life. Having been inspired by his own experiences with tutoring, being tutored, and caring for his younger brother Jason, he sought to emphasize the relational and emotional aspects of tutoring, along with the academical ones. Through BCT’s service, David hopes that families and students will not only receive the educational experience they may need but also the opportunity to cultivate and develop a lasting relationship with their tutor. In his spare time, he enjoys playing the oboe, writing for his school newspaper, and spending time with his family. David hopes to truly make a positive impact in his community by providing this service to any children in need of tutoring—regardless of their background.</p>
