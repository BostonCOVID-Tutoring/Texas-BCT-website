## Contributing

If you are thinking about contributing to the website, thank you for trying to help!

Here's what you need to know to get started

- Only push to the development branch
- Pushing (or merging) to master will trigger a Github action that **automatically publishes the website**
	- So please never do this unless your code has been reviewed and approved.
- We have created a [template](https://github.com/dphiggins/BCT-website/blob/master/public/assets/template.html) for our webpages. Use this to get started easily.

Below are a list of features we still need to add, in order of importance. Please feel free to get started on any open features.

1. Update Team Page (Dylan)
	- Split team page into Senior Management and Directory
	- Directory should have filters to select people in different roles

2. Create Locations tab and Naples Page (Unassigned)
	- Naples and Boston (highlight Boston is our HQ)
	- Tutees and Tutors in each location should sign up through different links and forms
	- Might make most sense to add a drop down of locations under sign up and Volunteer for now

3. Create Server Side database and logic for automation (Dan)
	- Tutor and Tutee Database
	- Automatic Tutee Assignment
	- Web Interface for Admins to easily manage tutors and tutees

4. Add electronic signature under the Sign Up form (Unassigned)

5. Add a contact page for email and social media. (Unassigned)
