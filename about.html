                <p>Boston COVID-Tutoring (BCT) was founded by high school students from the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, MA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide free online tutoring to students at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels to help fill in the academic gaps created by the disruption of traditional schooling. We welcome all students, regardless of their background (race, sex, immigrant status, etc.) to work with us in pursuit of their academic goals. BCT recognizes that all children have the right and deserve the opportunity to expand their knowledge and pursue their academic passions. Knowledge is the most powerful and important tool that impacts one's entire life from choosing a career path to pursuing an academic passion.

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Boston COVID-Tutoring was founded on the premise that learning is essential for success but also should be rewarding. Unfortunately, for many of us, COVID-19 has created obstacles to learning. Boston COVID-Tutoring attempts to address the resulting deficits. Our goal is to engage students, create opportunities for addressing academic shortcomings, and spark students' curiosity to make them lifelong learners.
